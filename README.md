# USA_HousesSalePrice-RegClas
Python Machine Learning Decission Tree and Random Forest algorithms for regression and classification of USA houses' sale price.
In this Jupyter Notebook I performed a dataset analysis and handled missing values of USA Housing Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/gpandi007/usa-housing-dataset?select=housing_train.csv) using Python Pandas and Sklearn modules.
I implemented both algorithms for a regression and classification problems, as well as compared both algorithms results at the end of the notebook.
